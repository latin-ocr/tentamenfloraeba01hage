BOTANJG MUSE s who tn this ιαιιενΙ aye
Led by your airy hand the Swedislz Saye,
Bade his keen eye your secret hazeins exploro
On dewy dell, hiqlz wood and winditzq shore,-
Say on each leaf how tiny Graces «lmen,-
How lauglz tlze Pleasures in α blossom’s bell,-
How insect Loves arise on cobweb winqs,

Aim their qulzt sbasts and point their little stinqs.
